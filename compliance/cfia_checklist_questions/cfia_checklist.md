# Food labelling requirements checklist
The following checklist is a self-assessment tool to help industry understand labelling requirements set out in the [_Food and Drugs Act_](https://inspection.canada.ca/english/reg/jredirect2.shtml?drga) (FDA) and Regulations and the [_Safe Food for Canadians Act_](https://inspection.canada.ca/english/reg/jredirect2.shtml?safefood) (SFCA) and Regulations.
The checklist only covers core labelling requirements applicable to all foods. For more information on voluntary claims or statements and commodity specific labelling requirements, visit the [Industry Labelling Tool](https://inspection.canada.ca/en/food-labels/labelling/industry).
**Labelling requirements checklist disclaimer:** Adherence to the labelling requirements checklist does not preclude the Canadian Food Inspection Agency from taking regulatory action in cases of non-compliance to regulatory and legislative labelling requirements. This publication is not a legal document. The user is encouraged to consult the official version of the applicable legislation in the FDA and in the SFCA for the purposes of interpreting and applying the law. The labelling requirements checklist was last modified in March 2024.
