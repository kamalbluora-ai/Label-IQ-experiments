      "context": "A Nutrition Facts table (NFt) is mandatory for most prepackaged foods sold in Canada. However, due to natural nutrient variation in human milk, it is challenging to establish accurate values to be declared in the NFt on prepackaged human milk. In addition, daily values (DV), the reference upon which the % DV in the NFt is based, have not been established for infants less than 6 months of age. Health Canada has published an interim policy exempting labels of prepackaged human milk from requiring an NFt. This exemption applies to prepackaged human milk and its prepackaged components (for example, human milk cream) distributed in Canada. The policy does not apply to the following foods:",
