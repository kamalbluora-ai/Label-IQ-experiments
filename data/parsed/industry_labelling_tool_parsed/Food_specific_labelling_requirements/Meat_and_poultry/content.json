As with all foods with a standard of identity, only those foods that meet all the provisions set out in the standard can use the prescribed common name [201, SCFR]. For meat products that do not fall under a standard, the appropriate common name is the name by which it is generally known or a name that is not generic and that describes the food [B.01.001(1), FDR; 1, SFCR].",
        "Prepackaged meat products can undergo various treatments that significantly alter their true nature. Examples of such treatments include cooking, curing, basting, drying and smoking. In these cases, when there is no prescribed common name for a meat product, a descriptive term that indicates the condition of the product resulting from the treatment must be included in its common name (for example, oven roasted, corned, basted, pickled, dried or smoked) in order to distinguish it from other foods for which it could be mistaken [B.01.006.1(c), FDR].",
        "Similarly, when a meat product included in Table 2 of the Canadian Standards of Identity, Volume 7 – Meat Products is subjected to a treatment or process that is not commonly used for that meat product, the common name of the meat product must refer to the use of the treatment or process [22(3), Canadian Standards of Identity, Volume 7 – Meat Products].",
        "For general information that applies to all foods, including meat products, refer to the Common name and True nature pages.",
        "For retail meats, the Meat cuts manual defines the common names for meat cuts of beef, horse, lamb, pork, poultry and veal, as well as the limits within which each name may be used. The Wholesale meat specifications document provides the nomenclature for wholesale cuts of beef, chicken, lamb, pork, turkey and veal. Information on common names for cuts of ostrich meat can be found under Ostrich meat cut nomenclature .",

Any references to the cut of meat must be truthful and not misleading. Refer to Ground meat for more information.",
        "A meat product that deviates from a prescribed standard may not use the common name associated with that standard unless the standardized common name is modified to indicate how the food differs, in every respect, from the food described by the standard.

The common name must be modified to describe the deviation from the standard, such as \"Meat Spread with Tomato\".",
        "Generally, coined names are not acceptable as common names. However, in some cases, coined names have been accepted as common names for unstandardized foods because they have become known to consumers over a long period of time or are commonly known. Coined names most commonly used for meat products include: fingers, nuggets, sticks and strips.",
        "Products that are made from a solid piece of meat may use terms such as \"Nuggets\" and \"Fingers\" as part of the common name without further qualifications, for example, \"Chicken Nuggets\".",
        "Products made from meat that has been chopped and formed may use terms such as \"Nuggets\" and \"Fingers\" as part of the common name provided the common name accurately describes the form of the meat, for example, \"Chicken Nuggets, Chopped and Formed\".",
        "Products made from chopped meat and containing fillers may be described as \"Nuggets\" and \"Fingers\" provided a descriptive name immediately follows, for example, \"Nugget Shaped Chicken Burgers\". Otherwise, the common name must fully describe the product.",

Furthermore, the meat must be comprised of a normal distribution of constituents (for example, muscle-fat ratio) as prescribed by common names and standards. The modifier is not permitted to appear between the prescribed words which make up the standardized common name, and to avoid potential confusion, the animal species should be included in the common name. The modifier should appear in the same size type and prominence as the common name.",

        "A species-specific common name to indicate that a meat product originated from a certain species or subspecies can be made on labels and in advertising provided the meat was derived from the carcass of a food animal of that species or subspecies. Examples of this would include, but are not limited to, Angus Beef, Wagyu Beef, Kobe Beef, Peking Duck, Muscovy Duck, North American Bison and Wild Boar.",
        "Proof of origin and segregation, such as paper documentation, of the animals used to create the product must be provided to a CFIA inspector upon request to substantiate the claim.",
        "When the subspecies is included as part of the common name of the meat product, such as burgers, ground meats products, patties or sausages, to avoid potential confusion, the animal species should be included in the common name and all should appear in the same type size and prominence.",
        "For example: \"Angus Beef Burger\" would be an acceptable common name for a product made from a meat block of 100% Angus beef.",

        "If a meat product consisting of meat, meat by-products, mechanically separated meat, or a combination of these meat ingredients is derived from more than one animal species, and any of these species is referred to in the common name, then all the animal species from which the meat ingredients are derived must be identified.",
        "For example: A meat loaf containing beef and mutton, and pork by-product as meat product ingredients shall be described as either \"Beef, Mutton and Pork Loaf\" or simply as \"Meat Loaf\".",
        "In the above example, beef constitutes the greatest proportion of the meat products used in the composition of the loaf, followed by mutton, and then pork by-product. The common name reflects the content of the 3 meat products in descending order of their proportion.",
        "The name used to describe all retail meat cuts, other than beef, must include an indication of the species. For example, the term \"veal\" must appear in conjunction with the term \"shoulder\" when a veal shoulder roast is offered for sale. However, the term \"beef\" is not required to appear on the label of a beef shoulder roast.",
        "Standards of identity are prescribed for ground meat under sections 13.1.4 to 13.1.6 of the Canadian Food Compositional Standards document and items 1 to 4 in Part A of Table 2 of the Canadian Standards of Identity, Volume 7 – Meat Products . The appropriate common name for these products is the name that corresponds with the fat content, and other aspects of the standard, as follows:",
        "Regular Ground (Naming the species or cut) – maximum 30% fat Medium Ground (Naming the species or cut) – maximum 23% fat Lean Ground (Naming the species or cut) – maximum 17% fat Extra Lean Ground (Naming the species or cut) – maximum 10% fat",
        "A product labelled with one of the above common names must not contain more than the maximum amount of fat and must only contain the ingredients provided for in the standard. The common name must accurately represent the animal species from which it is derived.",
        "For example: \"Regular Ground Beef\" may only contain beef with a fat content of 30% or lower.",
        "In addition to the above standards for ground meats, \"Meat Pattie\" and \"Meat Burger\" also have prescribed standards set out under items 7 to 9 in Part A of Table 2 of the Canadian Standards of Identity, Volume 7 – Meat Products . When combining the term \"pattie\" or \"burger\" with \"ground meat\" to describe a ground meat product, the product must meet the standards applicable to all the meat products in that name.",
        "For example: A product may only use the common name \"Lean Ground Beef Pattie\" if the product meets the standard for lean ground beef and does not contain any other ingredients. An appropriate common name for ground beef patties containing seasoning, salt or spices would be \"Beef Patties\".",
        "Section 1.0 of the Beef, Bison and Veal Carcass Grade Requirements – PDF (260 kb) (referred to as the Grades Document), prepared and published by the Canadian Beef Grading Agency, defines veal as the meat of a bovine animal with the hide off that has the maturity characteristics set out in Schedule IX of the Grades Document and a maximum carcass weight of 190 kg. Any carcass not meeting the definition of veal (for example, weighs more than 190 kg) must be labelled as beef. In this case, the carcass must meet all specifications for beef, including all other regulatory requirements for beef, such as grading.",
        "\"Ham\" means the edible meat product that is derived from the hind leg of a dressed swine carcass above the tarsal joint [1, Canadian Standards of Identity, Volume 7 – Meat Products ].",
        "The following nomenclature has been adopted for the description of ham when modifiers such as \"Boneless\" are used in conjunction with the common name.",
        "The term \"Whole Boneless Ham\" may be used where the product contains all the muscles or pieces of muscles in the same proportion as would be derived from a whole ham and where the proportion of shank meat does not exceed that normally present in a whole ham.",
        "The term \"Boneless Ham\" follows the same specifications as in \"Whole Boneless Ham\", except that some of the muscles or pieces of muscles derived from a whole ham need not be present.",
        "Note: The manufacturing process used in the production of either \"Whole Boneless Ham\" or \"Boneless Ham\" should be such that the resulting final product contains a minimum of 80% meat in pieces of muscle weighing 25 g or more on a raw meat ingredient basis [13.1.3, CFCS]. If the final product does not respect this proportion and size of pieces of meat, the product shall be identified as \"Chopped Ham\" or \"Minced Ham\".",
        "Food additives, such as gums and gelling agents, are not permitted for use as fillers . Where Lists of Permitted Food Additives include provisions for the use of a gelling agent , they may be used in amounts up to 0.25% of the meat product without being reflected in the product's common name. However, when a gelling agent has been added in quantities greater than 0.25% of the meat product, the common name of the meat product must refer to the addition of the gelling agent (with words such as \"jellied\" /\" en gelée \", \"with gelatin\" /\" avec gélatine \") [22(2), Canadian Standards of Identity, Volume 7 – Meat Products ]. In both these cases, the gelling agent used must be listed as an ingredient.",

        "The amount of water added and retained in raw single-ingredient meat products due to post-evisceration contact with water, in excess of naturally occurring moisture, must be declared as part of the product name on the principal display panel of consumer prepackaged products, or on the label of prepackaged other than consumer prepackaged products. Raw single-ingredient meat products include items such as dressed carcasses, parts of dressed carcasses, offal and giblets.",
        "Please note that standards for water retention in dressed poultry carcasses are set out in section 20 of the Canadian Standards of Identity, Volume 7 – Meat Products . As such, a declaration of retained water for dressed poultry carcasses is not required. However, poultry carcasses containing giblets (for example, frozen turkeys) require a retained water declaration for the giblets.",
        "When a licence holder follows the Poultry water retention control program , carcass parts may increase in weight up to specified limits without the need to declare the percentage of retained water on the label.",
        "When water retention is declared for raw single-ingredient meat products, the following 3 phrases are acceptable:",
        "\"up to X% water retained\" \"less than X% water retained\", and \"up to X% retained water added due to processing\"",
        "The retained water percentage is always rounded to the nearest whole number. Retained water below 0.5% does not need to be declared. The permitted labelling variation is a maximum of 20% above the declared amount within the retained water statement.",
        "Operators may include a \"no retained water\" statement on the label (optional) when no water added due to post-evisceration processing has been retained by the raw single-ingredient meat product.",
        "Note: A claim such as \"no water added\" is not permitted since it may likely be considered misleading under subsections 5(1) of the FDA and 6(1) of the SFCA. Refer to Negative claims pertaining to the absence or non-addition of a substance for more information.",
        "When the retained water declaration is presented as part of the product description, it must be conspicuously shown and written in characters not less than half the size of the product's common name or half the size of any additional mandatory information.",
        "Packages containing a variety of raw, single-ingredient meat products (for example, giblets) may declare the amount of retained water on the label by either:",

        "Only water absorbed and retained as part of the Kosher process may be excluded from the retained water declaration, provided that the product description contains the phrase \"soaked and salted\" or a similar phrase.",
        "Any retained water in raw single-ingredient meat products, used as ingredients, does not need to be declared on the label of prepared, including multi-ingredient, meat products (for example, raw or cooked sausage, pre-basted turkeys with or without giblets, giblets within a pre-basted turkey carcass, or deli meats). However, these meat products must comply with applicable standards of identity or composition requirements for the specific prepared meat product as described in the Canadian Standards of Identity, Volume 7 – Meat Products or in the Canadian Food Compositional Standards document .",
        "Meat products formed or bound by meat binders must be accurately reflected in the common name of the product. When a meat binder is used to bind meat of the same species, the common name of the product should be \"formed (naming the product) with (naming the meat binder)\" or \"(naming the product) pieces bound with (naming the meat binder)\".",

        "The use of the term \"seasoned\" in conjunction with the product's common name has been found to be acceptable when phosphate salts alone or with water are incorporated into a product. Similarly, the use of the term \"seasoned\" is also acceptable when spices are added with water. However, if water alone (for example, water being the only non-meat ingredient) is added, then an expression such as \"water added\" must be part of the product's common name.",

These statements enable consumers to make price and quality comparisons. The letter type must be at least as legible and conspicuous as any other type on that display panel, and in a minimum of half the size of the letters used in the rest of the common name of the product.

Retailers should, therefore, make sure that they get this information so that they can properly label products which they package.

For the meat and poultry meat required to have the percent (%) meat protein declaration applicable to type 1 and type 2 products, it also triggers the NFt, even if other exemptions apply, such as the less than 200 cm 2 available display surface or manufactured on premises.

        "See Declaration of the minimum meat protein content as part of the common name for more details on labelling requirements and minimum protein levels.",
        "The purpose of the policy is to provide information on sampling plans and tolerances to help in the accurate labelling of meat products with added phosphate salts and/or water.",
        "It is the responsibility of industry to ensure that the food meets the protein composition requirements of the applicable regulations and that labelling information accurately reflects the nutrient content of the product. Manufacturers should have good quality control of the formulation of the product to minimize variability. Results obtained by following a sampling plan will help with verification of labelling information and formula control.",
        "For the purpose of this section, \"lot\" and \"sample\" have been defined as follows:",
        "A lot is a collection of primary containers or units of the same size, type and style produced under conditions as uniform as possible, with a common container code, marking or, if both a code and marking are absent, were part of a same day's production. In no case would more than a day's production be considered a lot.",
        "A sample is the unit of analysis. It shall consist of 5 units selected randomly from a lot; the units may be composited and analyzed as a single sample, or may be analyzed individually and the results averaged.",
        "Note: Bones, covering pork rind or a visible fat layer (for example, subcutaneous fat or fat between the muscles) shall not be included in a sample used to determine meat protein content for the purpose of the minimum meat protein content [B.14.021, B.22.012, FDR]. It is also not included in the main panel declaration of protein content [B.01.090, FDR].",
        "A sample size of 5 consumer units is used in all cases. The sampling plan provides the option of either a composite sample or the average of individual samples. Either method will give values which are representative of the lot. Analysis of individual samples, however, will permit calculation of the nutrient variability from container to container.",
        "The production lot should be properly sampled and analyzed by trained staff using recognized methods of measurement such as Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) methods Footnote 2 . The analyst may determine how best to collect and analyze products in order to ensure accuracy of the declared values.",

        "For the front panel statement of the percent (%) meat protein content as part of the common name, a 10% tolerance from label value is applied where the declaration is above the minimum level. This level balances the need for reliable values to allow consumers to make informed choices with the need for a technically achievable range. There may be significant variability in the protein content of meat and poultry products containing added phosphate or water as a result of variabilities in food manufacturing and processing systems and the inherent variability of protein in the food.",
        "The lot is deemed to be out of compliance when the protein content of the sample (composite or mean) is less than the minimum meat protein requirement, or when a single unit is less than 90% of the minimum.",
        "Where the percent (%) meat protein declaration is equal to the minimum required protein level, a lot would be considered as non-compliant if the meat protein content of the sample (composite or mean) is less than the minimum, or if a single unit is less than 90% of the minimum. Where the declared percent (%) meat protein is greater than the minimum required protein level, a lot is considered as non-compliant when the meat protein content of the sample (composite or mean) is less than 90% of the declared value.",
        "Meat protein content levels that are greater than the amount declared are acceptable, provided they are within good manufacturing practices."
