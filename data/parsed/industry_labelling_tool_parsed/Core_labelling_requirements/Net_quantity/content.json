However, consumer prepackaged foods that are packaged from bulk at retail, other than individually measured foods, can declare the net quantity on the principal display panel in Canadian units [241.4(2)(b), SFCR].",
        "Generally, the net quantity must be indicated [231(b), 233(1), SFCR]:",
        "by volume for liquids: in millilitres (or for amounts of 1000 milliliters or more, in litres) by weight for solids: in grams (for amounts of 1000 grams or more, in kilograms) by count for certain foods",
        "Refer to When to use weight, volume or count for additional information.",
        "For catch-weight foods or foods packaged from bulk at retail, that are less than 1000 grams (that is to say, 1 kg), the net quantity may be expressed as a decimal fraction of a kilogram [233(3), SFCR].",
        "Example: The net quantity of a prepackaged raw small whole chicken is 980 grams. It is acceptable to declare the net quantity for this product as \"0.980 kg\".",
        "A single space should be used to separate the number from the unit of measure. For example, 500 g is acceptable, whereas \"500g\", \"500 g\", and \"500 g \" are unacceptable.",
        "Phrases such as \"net\", \"net weight\", \"net contents\" or \"net quantity\" are voluntary and not required as part of the net quantity declaration.",
        "When the quantity is less than 1, the numerical portion may be shown in either the decimal system with the figure zero preceding the decimal point (for example, 0.5 kilogram), or in words (for example, one-half kilogram) [235, SFCR]. Numerical fractions (for example, ⅛, ¼, ⅓, ½, ¾, ⅞, etc.) are not acceptable in the metric system and must never be used to express metric measure.",
        "The net quantity must be rounded to 3 figures, unless the net quantity is below 100 g or 100 ml. If the net quantity is below 100 g or 100 ml, it may be rounded to 2 figures. In addition, any final zero appearing to the right of the decimal point need not be shown [234, SFCR].",
        "Example: 453.59 becomes 454; 85.6 becomes 86; 6.43 becomes 6.4.",
        "If the net quantity is exactly 500 grams or 500 millilitres, it may be expressed as [233(2), SFCR]:",

        "The above symbols are case sensitive and only litre and millilitre measurements have case or font options. The \"g\" for grams cannot be replaced by \"G\".",

        "The average system is based on the following criteria and the lot will be compliant if all three are met:",
        "1. The quantity declared on a package should accurately reflect the quantity being supplied, so the average net contents of the packages in a lot may not be less than the declared net quantity [200(4)(a), SFCR]. This recognizes that production techniques are neither perfect nor ideal, it is sufficient that the average of the packages contain the declared quantity. This requirement provides protection to consumers who purchase more than one package of a particular product. Generally, a deficiently filled package will be compensated for by an overfilled one. 2. The number of units in a sample from the lot containing less than the declared net quantity, by more than the prescribed tolerance, may not exceed the number permitted by the Regulations [200(4)(b), SFCR]. The control over production should be such that the individual packages are within allowable tolerances and only a few units may have a negative error larger that the tolerance. 3. The number of packages which may have excessive negative errors is limited. This means that only one package may contain less than twice the tolerance [200(4)(c), SFCR]. In recognition of an occasional mishap in the packing process, the presence of one significantly underweight package in the sample will not jeopardize the results of the inspection.",

For example, it is not acceptable to package 200 millitres of a beverage in a container having a capacity of 250 millitres. This would result in a head-space of at least 24%, often referred to as \"slack-fill\", and would be misleading with respect to the quantity of the product [6(1), SFCA].",
        "However, this practice may be acceptable if the product justifiably requires an extra space within the container. In this case, a statement explaining the purpose of the extra space is required on the label. For example, a milk shake requires an extra space for mixing and therefore would be required to carry a statement such as \"An extra space is provided for shaking purposes\".",

If a manufacturer chooses to declare the net quantity of a prepackaged product in an advertisement, then the net quantity declared must be in accordance with section 216 of the SFCR. For example, the net quantity of a food cannot be less than the amount of food stated in an advertisement, as that would be misleading.",

Gift baskets made up of completely labelled fancy biscuits, candies and cheeses, etc., together in an over wrapped basket also fall into this category.
