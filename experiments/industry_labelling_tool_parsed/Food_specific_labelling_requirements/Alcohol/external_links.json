Provincial regulations may also have labelling requirements that apply when these products are sold within that province.",

Subparagraph 2.2.1(b)(ii) of the Canadian Food Compositional Standards document provides for rum to contain \"flavouring\" as authorized under the Excise Act [B.02.002, FDR]. The Excise Act permits up to 9.09% of the total quantity of absolute ethyl alcohol in the product (which equates to 10% by weight) flavouring in the rum. Subsection B.02.031(1) of the FDR requires the rum to be aged a minimum of 1 year in small wood and subsection B.02.031(2) also requires the flavouring portion to be aged at least 1 year in small wood. The Canada Revenue Agency has interpreted this and their regulations (Circular 203-1) to mean, a 12 year old rum can contain flavouring up to 9.09% that is aged less than 12 years but at least 1 year, and it is still considered to be 12 year old rum. If more than 9.09% of younger rum is added, the claim 12 year old rum would no longer be acceptable.",
