The Excise Act permits up to 9.09% of the total quantity of absolute ethyl alcohol in the product (which equates to 10% by weight) flavouring in the rum. Subsection B.02.031(1) of the FDR requires the rum to be aged a minimum of 1 year in small wood and subsection B.02.031(2) also requires the flavouring portion to be aged at least 1 year in small wood. The Canada Revenue Agency has interpreted this and their regulations (Circular 203-1) to mean, a 12 year old rum can contain flavouring up to 9.09% that is aged less than 12 years but at least 1 year, and it is still considered to be 12 year old rum. If more than 9.09% of younger rum is added, the claim 12 year old rum would no longer be acceptable.",
