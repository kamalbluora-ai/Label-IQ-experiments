        "Where there is no specific standard for a fat or oil in the CFCS document or other federal regulations, other national or international standards are referred to in order to determine an appropriate common name. For example, if there is a specific definition for a fat or oil in a Codex standard , the Codex defined name of the fat or oil (including one of its acceptable synonyms) would be an acceptable common name of the food. In order to use the Codex defined name of the food, the fat or oil is expected to meet the compositional requirements for it as set out in the Codex standard.",
        "Where there is no specific regulatory, national or international standard for a fat or oil, the name by which the fat or oil is generally known or a name that is not generic and describes the food is an acceptable common name [B.01.001(1), FDR; 1, SFCR].",
        "For more information, including placement, language and type size of common name, refer to Common name .",
        "Fats and oils used as ingredients in foods must be declared by their common name in the list of ingredients or, where there is a provision, by a class name. Refer to the List of ingredients for more information.",
        "The common name of a vegetable oil that contains only 1 oil must be the specific name of the oil present, that is, \"(naming the source) oil\". For example, the common name of 100% canola oil must be \"canola oil\". The general term \"vegetable oil\" is not an acceptable common name by itself, although it may appear in addition to \"canola oil\".",
        "For information on the declaration of single or multi-source vegetable oils in the list of ingredients, see Single or multi-source vegetable oils .",
        "\"Vegetable oil\" is an acceptable common name for an oil that contains more than 1 type of vegetable oil (and no other types of oil, such as animal or marine fat or oil).",
        "For information on the declaration of single or multi-source vegetable oils in the list of ingredients, see Single or multi-source vegetable oils .",
        "When a single fat or oil from vegetable, animal or marine sources has been modified or fully hydrogenated, the common name on the principal display panel and in the list of ingredients must include the word \"modified\" or \"hydrogenated\", as appropriate (for example, \"hydrogenated canola oil\", \"hydrogenated palm kernel oil\", \"modified soybean oil\", \"modified coconut oil\", \"modified beef tallow\", \"hydrogenated sardine oil\") [B.01.010(3)(a), FDR; items 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 of Table 1 of Common Names for Ingredients and Components document].",
        "When 2 or more vegetable fats or oils, or marine fats or oils, are present and 1 or more of them has been modified or fully hydrogenated, the common name on the principal display panel and in the list of ingredients must include the word \"modified\" or \"hydrogenated\", as appropriate (for example, \"modified vegetable oil\", \"hydrogenated vegetable oil\", \"modified marine oil\", \"hydrogenated fish oil\") [B.01.010(3)(a), FDR; items 14, 16, 17 and 19 of Table 1 of Common Names for Ingredients and Components document].",
        "The common name for mixtures of regular and modified vegetable oils can be \"modified vegetable oil\". Alternatively, a common name can be used which incorporates the individual ingredients of the product. For example, a mixture of 95% canola oil and 5% modified sunflower oil could be called either \"modified vegetable oil\" or \"canola oil and modified sunflower oil\".",
        "The FDR do not specifically require that \"interesterification\" be declared in the common name of the product. However, the CFIA encourages the use of the common name \"interesterified (naming the vegetable oil)\" unless the final food meets the standard for shortening [8.3.1, CFCS]; in that case, the common name must be shortening.",
        "Some oils have been developed with nutritional profiles that differ from the traditional oil made from the same plant source. In most cases, these foods are subject to Health Canada's novel food assessment process. See Genetically modified (GM) foods and other novel foods for more information.",
        "Common names must accurately describe the food. As such, an acceptable common name for an oil with a modified nutritional profile includes:",
        "the plant source of the oil the nutritional difference from the traditional oil",
        "Examples: High oleic sunflower seed oil, low linolenic acid soybean oil",
        "Specifications for oils are outlined in various standards such as those in the CFCS document, incorporated by reference into the FDR, and the Codex Standard for Named Vegetable Oils (CXS 210-1999). These specifications can be used to determine if the nutritional profile of a modified oil falls outside of the range of the traditional oil from the same plant source.",
        "When there is a nutritional difference from the traditional oil, this needs to be reflected in the common name. Representations in the common name that characterize the amount of a fatty acid in vegetable oil are generally permitted (for example \"high oleic (naming the source) oil\") [B.01.502(2)(i), FDR ]. There may be more than one way to describe the nutritional difference in the common name, such as when the content of more than 1 fatty acid has changed (for example, when a fatty acid is increased and another has decreased). Note that in some cases, such as for high oleic acid sunflower seed oil, there is a Codex standard for the modified oil as well.",
        "This type of common name (for example, \"high oleic (naming the source) oil\") would trigger a declaration of the amount of fatty acid in grams per stated serving size outside the Nutrition Facts table [B.01.301(1), FDR ]. See Modified fatty acid content oil for information on nutrition labelling requirements when a representation in the common name characterizes the amount of a fatty acid.",
        "The common name \"canola oil\" is acceptable on the label of oil produced from low erucic acid Brassica juncea .",
        "Note: there are other types of Brassica juncea that are considered mustard plants and a source of mustard oil.",
        "The Codex Standard for Named Vegetable Oils (CXS 210-1999) recognizes Brassica juncea as a source of low erucic acid rapeseed oil as follows:",
        "Rapeseed oil - (Low erucic acid) - (low erucic acid turnip rape oil; low erucic acid colza oil; canola oil) is produced from low erucic acid oil-bearing seeds of varieties derived from the Brassica napus L. , Brassica rapa L. and Brassica juncea L. , species.",
        "Although there is no prescribed name for the oil of this plant in the CFCS document or any other federal legislation, this oil is generally known as \"canola oil\" in Canada, and this is the appropriate common name to use.",
        "This approach is consistent with CFIA 's Seed Program, which recognizes the name \"Canola quality, Brassica juncea \" for this plant and lists it under \"canola\" on the website index of varieties registered in Canada. This approach is also consistent with CFIA 's Feed section with respect to the meal derived from Brassica juncea . This product has gone through a novel food assessment by Health Canada.",
        "Products that are represented or sold as olive oil or pure olive oil are subject to the standard of composition for this product, which states in part, that olive oil shall be obtained from the fruit of the olive tree ( Olea europaea L) [8.1.2, CFCS].",

        "Acceptable common names for oil derived from olive residues are \"olive pomace oil\" and \"olive residual oil\" (in French, \"huile de grignons d'olive\" and \"huile de résidus d'olive\", respectively). This is based on usages sanctioned by certain foreign governments and by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. The terms \"sansa oil\" / \"huile de sansa\" are not acceptable.",
        "The common names \"high-oleic sunflower oil\" and \"mid-oleic sunflower oil\" are acceptable for oils that meet the standard for those products in the Codex Standard for Named Vegetable Oils (CXS 210-1999).",
        "See Modified fatty acid content oil and Oils with modified nutritional profiles for more information on the labelling requirements when a representation in the common name characterizes the amount of a fatty acid.",
        "For information on mid-oleic sunflower oil that has gone through a Health Canada novel food assessment, see Health Canada's page on approved products .",
        "The common name \"liquid shortening\" is an acceptable common name for products that function as shortenings but that are in liquid form, rather than in \"semi-solid\" form as described in the standard for shortening.",
        "Medium chain triglycerides may be used as foods or food ingredients. When sold as a food, the acceptable common name is \"medium chain triglycerides\". The abbreviation \"MCT\" is not acceptable. A label declaration of the source of the medium chain triglycerides, preferably on the principal display panel, is also recommended to alert allergic or sensitive individuals, for example, \"modified coconut oil\".",
        "Palm olein, palm stearin and palm superolein are produced from the fractionation of palm oil. When these oils are sold singly as a food, \"palm olein\", \"palm stearin\" and \"palm superolein\" are the designated common names of these fatty acid modified oils (see Codex Standard for Named Vegetable Oils (CXS 210-1999)). All other fractions of palm oil should be called \"modified palm oil\" when sold as a food.",
        "Vegetable diacylglycerol oil (DAG oil) is vegetable oil that has been formulated to contain more than 80% diglycerides. The common name of a vegetable diacylglycerol oil must be \"vegetable diacylglycerol oil\" or \"(naming the source) diacylglycerol oil\".",
        "However, when the source of the oil is coconut oil, palm kernel oil, peanut oil or cocoa butter, the term \"vegetable diacylglycerol oil\" must not be used. Instead, the common name must be \"(naming the source) diacylglycerol oil\" [B.01.010(3)(b) FDR; item 1 of Table 2 of Common Names for Ingredients and Components document].",
