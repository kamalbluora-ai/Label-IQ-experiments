        "Although standardized alcoholic beverages are not exempt from declaring allergens, Health Canada has developed a position on the labelling requirements for vintage wines. This position indicates that the allergen labelling regulations apply to all non-vintage wines and vintage wines with a year date of 2012 and later, and that vintage wines with a year date of 2011 or earlier can continue to be sold with their original labels. For more information on this subject, refer to Health Canada's position on Vintage wine and application of enhanced allergen regulations .",
        "Based on a detailed assessment by Health Canada, highly refined (degummed, neutralized, bleached and deodorized) oils derived from food allergen sources are not subject to the enhanced labelling requirements as the refining process has been determined to remove the allergenic protein from the oil. Based on the available science, the very low levels of protein present within highly refined oils are not considered to pose a risk to the health of individuals with food allergies. For more information on this subject, refer to Health Canada's position on highly refined oils derived from food allergen sources ."

Sandwiches are generally understood to be a filling between 2 pieces of bread, but as there is no legal definition, it was determined that the exemption should include foods commonly considered to be sandwiches, even if they are made with bread-like products. This exemption would apply to a sandwich made with pita or other bread-like products such as tortillas, chapatis and croissants, provided the pita or other bread-like product surrounds the filling or the filling is contained between portions of the bread-like product.

With respect to the cheese seasoning and basil and lime dressing, their total collective weight must be calculated as a percentage of the total weight of all ingredients (excluding the weight of added water lost during manufacture): Total collective weight of the cheese seasoning and the basil and lime dressing = 0.75 kg + 0.50 kg = 1.25 kg Total weight of all ingredients (excluding the weight of added water lost during manufacture) = 98.00 kg – 17.50 kg = 80.50 kg % cheese seasoning and basil and lime dressing = (1.25 kg / 80.50 kg) x 100 = 1.55% Since this amount is no more than 2%, the cheese seasoning and the basil and lime dressing may be simply referred to as \"seasonings\" at the end of the list of ingredients and none of their ingredients and components must be declared in the list of ingredients, other than salt which must be declared separately. Refer to Food allergen, gluten and added sulphites declarations for manner of declaring the milk allergen in the cheese seasoning and any other allergens present.

Therefore, a sugars-based ingredient that is a monosaccharide, disaccharide or a combination of these refers to sugars that have their common name ending in \"-ose\" or contains the word \"sugar\". This includes glucose-fructose, cane sugar, sucrose, beet sugar, and lactose. Refer to Annex 1A: examples of sugars-based ingredients that are monosaccharide, disaccharide or a combination of these for a list of additional examples.",

        "Sweetening agents may also have other functions including, flavouring, preservation, browning/caramelization, and colouring.",
        "A \"functional substitute for a sweetening agent\" is generally not an obvious source of sugars in the food. For example, fruit juice concentrate may not be familiar to some as a source of sugars. Grouping of sugars-based ingredients may help consumers identify these hidden sources of sugars in their foods.",
        "For example: below are the ingredients in a fruit-berry salad dressing in descending order. Ingredients: Water, Concentrated white grape juice, White wine vinegar, Canola oil, Strawberry puree, Dijon mustard (water, mustard seeds, vinegar, salt, turmeric), Concentrated raspberry juice, Concentrated blackberry juice, Salt, Concentrated lemon juice, Poppy seeds, Spices and Xanthan gum The ingredients \"concentrated white grape juice, strawberry puree, concentrated raspberry juice, and concentrated blackberry juice\" are replacing a sweetening agent (for example, sugar) and have 1 or more functions of the sweetening agent such as texturing (strawberry puree) and colour (concentrated juices). Therefore these ingredients are functional substitutes for a sweetening agent and must be grouped together in brackets following the term \"Sugars\", as follows: Ingredients: Water • Sugars (concentrated white grape juice, strawberry puree, concentrated raspberry juice, concentrated blackberry juice) • White wine vinegar • Canola oil • Dijon mustard (water, mustard seeds, vinegar, salt, turmeric) • Salt • Concentrated lemon juice • Poppy seeds • Spices • Xanthan gum Contains: Mustard",
        "As such, the sugars-based ingredients listed below in Annex 1C: list of sugars-based ingredients that are functional substitutes for sweetening agents must always be grouped after the term \"Sugars\" in the list of ingredients. Apart from this list, there are other ingredients containing sugars, which may have a function in the food in addition to sweetening. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to be able to demonstrate that such an ingredient performs a function other than sweetening the food, otherwise it should be grouped. It is also permitted to include in the sugars grouping, any other ingredient containing sugars regardless of its purpose in the food.",

        "Sugar alcohols (for example, maltitol) and sweeteners such as steviol glycosides or aspartame cannot be grouped as \"Sugars\" in the list of ingredients.",
        "Since the aim is to group hidden sources of sugars, there is no need to group ingredients such as chocolate that are well-known as sources of sugar. In addition, no grouping is required for ingredients that are visible in intact pieces or layers such as yogurt coating or pieces of frozen fruits.",
        "For example: consider a cookie manufacturer who produces raisin and cranberry cookies. The manufacturer adds dried raisins and cranberries to the cookie dough at the final stage of production just before baking the cookies. The dried fruits appear as distinct and intact pieces within the cookie dough and therefore are considered as obvious sources of sugars.",
