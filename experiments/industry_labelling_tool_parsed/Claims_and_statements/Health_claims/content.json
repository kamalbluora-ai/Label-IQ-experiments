        "For more information refer to Nutrient and health-related claims and the front-of-package (FOP) nutrition symbol of the FOP nutrition symbol labelling guide for industry.",
        "When a disease risk reduction claim or a therapeutic claim is shown on the label of a SF that carries a supplemented food caution identifier (SFCI), the representation is also subject to type size restrictions [B.29.029, FDR].",
        "For more information refer to Restrictions on size of acceptable claims for supplemented foods with a supplemented food caution identifier in the Health Canada Guidance document: Supplemented Foods Regulations",
        "When these claims appear on a label, they must be present in both English and French unless a bilingual labelling exemption applies to the product [B.01.012(3) and (7), B.01.600, FDR].",
        "When a claim appears on the label of a prepackaged food or in advertisements placed by or on the direction of the manufacturer of the food, the label of the food must carry a Nutrition Facts table (NFt) [B.01.401, FDR].",
        "Foods that are normally exempt from providing an NFt lose their exemption and are required to declare an NFt. See Reasons for losing the exemption . In addition, the nutrition information required by column 3 of the Table of disease risk reduction claims must appear in the NFt [B.01.401(3)(e)(ii), FDR].",
        "Fresh vegetables and fruits without any added ingredients are always exempted from the requirement to carry an NFt. The use of a disease risk reduction claim, on the label or in an advertisement, does not trigger the NFt or any accompanying nutrition information [B.01.401(2)(c)(i), FDR].",
        "When a disease risk reduction or therapeutic claim appears on the label of a supplemented food that has an ADS of less than 100 cm 2 , the food loses its small package exemption and is required to carry a Supplemented Food Facts table [B.029.018(2)(b)(iii), FDR]. For more information, refer to small package exemption in the Health Canada Guidance document: Supplemented Foods Regulations .",
        "The regulations prescribe the exact wording for the permitted disease risk reduction claims in column 1 of the Table of disease risk reduction claims . The wording of the health claims cannot be modified, and no intervening information, graphic sign or symbol may come between parts of the claim. However, words, numbers, signs or symbols may come before or after the health claim, provided that they do not change the nature of the claim [B.01.603(1), FDR]. In the case of advertisements, all parts of the claim must be displayed in equal prominence with no parts highlighted [B.01.602(1)(a), FDR].",

        "Split claims are not permitted, that is to say, presenting the claim in 2 sections on different parts of the label. Because the risk reduction is associated with the total diet and not with the individual food, the diet part of the claim is the most important.",
        "There are specific restrictions to be aware of when using disease risk reduction claims and therapeutic claims on certain supplemented foods. Refer to Regulatory requirements and guidance for use of nutrition and health-related statements and claims on supplemented foods of Health Canada's Guidance document: Supplemented Foods Regulations for more information.",
        "The \"Naming the food\" segment of the claim must be completed appropriately. This can be done with the use, at a minimum, of the common name of the food. If the nutrient content claim portion of the health claim does not apply to all foods of that type, then a brand name may accompany the common name. If other information is required to distinguish the food from another similar food with the same common name and brand name, other information may be permitted as part of the description of the food. For example, \"A healthy diet low in saturated and trans fat may reduce the risk of heart disease. Johnny's 100% fat-free turkey breast is free of saturated and trans fat\" would be acceptable to distinguish the food from Johnny's regular turkey breast with 4% fat.",
        "If the nutrient content claim portion describes all foods of that type, then \"Naming the food\" must be stated in such a way as to indicate that the claim characterizes all foods of that type. A brand name may not be used to name the food. This is consistent with the requirements set out in section B.01.511, FDR. For example, \"A healthy diet low in saturated and trans fat may reduce the risk of heart disease. Applesauce is free of saturated and trans fats.\"",
        "It is not appropriate to only use a brand name or trade name to name the food. For example, to only use a brand name in the following claim would not be acceptable as the brand name does not name the food. \"A healthy diet low in saturated and trans fat may reduce the risk of heart disease. Johnny's is free of saturated and trans fat.\"",
        "Other than the \"Naming the food\" segment, only the last few words of the claim change, depending on the circumstances. For example, notice the difference between item 3(1) and item 3(2) in the Table of disease risk reduction claims . In item 3(1) the food is \"free\" of saturated and trans fat, whereas in item 3(2), the food is \"low\" in saturated and trans fat.",
        "Accompanying information is required when a disease risk reduction claim is present in an advertisement for a prepackaged product (other than a radio or television advertisement) made by someone other than the manufacturer (such as a marketing board). The accompanying information required is namely the nutrition information as per column 3 of the Table of disease risk reduction claims . It must be adjacent to the most prominent claim in the advertisement (without any intervening material), and it must appear in letters of the same size and prominence as the claim [B.01.602(1)(a), FDR].",
        "Similarly, when a disease risk reduction claim appears on the label or in an advertisement for a non-prepackaged food (such as bulk food), the nutrition information required by column 3 of the Table of disease risk reduction claims must appear on the label or the advertisement. The same requirements for placement of information would apply [B.01.602(1)(a), FDR].",
        "When these claims are made in a radio advertisement, the accompanying information, being the nutrition information required by column 3 of the Table of disease risk reduction claims , must be communicated immediately preceding or following the claim [B.01.602(1)(b), FDR].",
        "In the case of a television advertisement, the accompanying information, namely the nutrition information required by column 3 of the Table of disease risk reduction claims , must be declared based on the manner in which the disease risk reduction claim is delivered, that is to say, audio mode, visual mode, or both the audio and visual modes.",
        "When the claim is delivered in the audio portion of the advertisement only, the accompanying information must be communicated immediately preceding or following the claim in audio mode, or in both the audio and visual modes [B.01.602(1)(c), FDR]. When the claim is delivered in the visual portion of the advertisement only, the accompanying information must be communicated immediately preceding or following the claim in the audio mode or in the visual mode [B.01.602(1)(c), FDR]. In the case where the claim is made in both the audio and visual portions of a television advertisement, the accompanying information must be in the audio mode or in both the audio and visual modes. In the case where the accompanying information appears in the visual mode, it must appear at the same time and for the same length of time as the claim; must be adjacent to (without intervening material) the most prominent (or only) claim; and must be in letters of at least the same size and prominence as the claim [B.01.602(2), FDR]."

        "When a function claim appears on the label or in an advertisement for a non-prepackaged product or in any advertisement for a prepackaged product not made or placed by or on the direction of the manufacturer or importer, the quantitative amount of the food constituent (per serving of stated size) that is the subject of the function claim should also appear on the label or in the advertisement.",

In these cases, the amount of the food or food constituent required to produce the desired effect and the amount of the food or food constituent in a serving of stated size of the food must be declared as part of the function claim. For example, \"1 tsp of (naming the product) provides 3g of fibre from coarse wheat bran. Consuming 7 grams of fibre from coarse wheat bran daily promotes regularity\".",
        "Companies wanting to make function claims must have scientific evidence to validate the claim prior to its use on food labels or in advertisements. This evidence may be used by the CFIA, in collaboration with Health Canada, to evaluate product compliance with the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations . Consequently, manufacturers and importers are encouraged to contact the Food Directorate of Health Canada for advice regarding the acceptability of function claims on food products prior to their use. Claims reviewed and found to be acceptable will be added to the Table of acceptable food or food constituent function claims .",
        "Health Canada considers the following factors in determining the acceptability of new function claims:",
        "Standards of evidence Manufacturers who make function claims on their food products must ensure that they meet acceptable standards of evidence in supporting their claims. The evidence must be applicable to the target group for the claim. For example, the physiological effect of a food or food constituent (for example, promotes normal transit time) is not considered to be supported when the evidence is based on therapeutic (treatment) effects in sick populations (for example, treatment of diarrhea). The amount of the food or food constituent required to achieve the claimed physiological effect must be based on the evidence supporting the claim. The target population must be able to consume the amount of food or food constituent required to achieve the effect as part of a healthy, balanced diet. The amount of the food or food constituent required to achieve the claimed physiological effect could be consumed in a reasonable daily intake (RDI) of the food (refer to Reasonable daily intake of various foods ). Where no RDI has been established, the amount of the food or food constituent to achieve the claimed physiological effect is to be consumed in a single serving of stated size, unless the function claim is related to a food constituent that is available in a variety of foods. In this case, the amount of the food constituent in the food per serving of stated size and the amount of the food constituent required to achieve the claimed effect or benefit must be declared along with the claim. Clearly stated specific physiological effect Acceptable function claims are claims about a food or food constituent that clearly state a specific and scientifically supported physiological effect (for example, promotes regularity) associated with good health or performance. Claims that state a specific effect provide more useful information for the consumer and are less likely to be misleading or misunderstood than a claim about a general or broad effect. Function claims also must not give the impression that the food is \"healthier\" than, or \"nutritionally superior\" to, other similar foods not bearing the claims. Claims that state a general or broad effect (for example, supports immune function/system) are not considered acceptable. As a general rule, a vague, non-specific or broad claim is acceptable only for a well-established role of energy or a known nutrient in maintaining the functions of the body essential for the maintenance of good health or for normal growth and development (see Nutrient function claims ). A non-specific or broad claim is also subject to interpretation and inference and in some cases could be considered a drug claim (see No drug representations for function claims ). Use these examples to help you determine if a claim is \" specific \" or \" vague \".",
        "The function claims listed in the table below, when used with the specified conditions (see column 3, \"Conditions for use\"), are acceptable. The table will be updated as new claims for food or food constituents are reviewed and found to be acceptable by Health Canada.",
        "The term \"laxation\" is accepted as referring to the normal softness and bulking of the stool resulting from such factors as increased undigested residue or bacterial mass, trapping of gases or water retention.",
        "Claims for the promotion of \"laxation\" or \"regularity\" are acceptable for foods when a reasonable daily intake of the food contains a minimum of 7 grams of dietary fibre from coarse wheat bran. Such claims may be made for other foods provided that the claim is substantiated by evidence from clinical studies that a reasonable daily intake of the foods has a laxation effect and no adverse effects. If a reasonable daily intake is made up of several servings, the amount of the food required to produce the laxation effect and the number of servings it comprises should be declared as part of the claim. See Dietary fibre of the Elements within the Nutrition Facts table web page for further information on fibre sources.",

          "text": "Standards of evidence Manufacturers who make function claims on their food products must ensure that they meet acceptable standards of evidence in supporting their claims. The evidence must be applicable to the target group for the claim. For example, the physiological effect of a food or food constituent (for example, promotes normal transit time) is not considered to be supported when the evidence is based on therapeutic (treatment) effects in sick populations (for example, treatment of diarrhea). The amount of the food or food constituent required to achieve the claimed physiological effect must be based on the evidence supporting the claim. The target population must be able to consume the amount of food or food constituent required to achieve the effect as part of a healthy, balanced diet. The amount of the food or food constituent required to achieve the claimed physiological effect could be consumed in a reasonable daily intake (RDI) of the food (refer to Reasonable daily intake of various foods ). Where no RDI has been established, the amount of the food or food constituent to achieve the claimed physiological effect is to be consumed in a single serving of stated size, unless the function claim is related to a food constituent that is available in a variety of foods. In this case, the amount of the food constituent in the food per serving of stated size and the amount of the food constituent required to achieve the claimed effect or benefit must be declared along with the claim. Clearly stated specific physiological effect Acceptable function claims are claims about a food or food constituent that clearly state a specific and scientifically supported physiological effect (for example, promotes regularity) associated with good health or performance. Claims that state a specific effect provide more useful information for the consumer and are less likely to be misleading or misunderstood than a claim about a general or broad effect. Function claims also must not give the impression that the food is \"healthier\" than, or \"nutritionally superior\" to, other similar foods not bearing the claims. Claims that state a general or broad effect (for example, supports immune function/system) are not considered acceptable. As a general rule, a vague, non-specific or broad claim is acceptable only for a well-established role of energy or a known nutrient in maintaining the functions of the body essential for the maintenance of good health or for normal growth and development (see Nutrient function claims ). A non-specific or broad claim is also subject to interpretation and inference and in some cases could be considered a drug claim (see No drug representations for function claims ). Use these examples to help you determine if a claim is \" specific \" or \" vague \".",
