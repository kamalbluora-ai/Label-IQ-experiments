It is therefore considered inappropriate and misleading to use nutrient content claims to suggest that an infant formula is superior to another based on its nutrient content. Consequently, only a very limited number of nutrient content claims are permitted on infant formulas, mainly to highlight differences in formulas rather than to suggest superiority.",
        "Health Canada's policy is that nutrient content claims, other than iron claims, are only acceptable for formulas represented for infants 6 months of age or older (known as follow-up formulas) because follow-up formulas contain higher levels of some nutrients, such as calcium, to meet the needs of the older infant.",

For instance, these may be used to differentiate infant formula with and without added sources of the long chain fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA), the addition of which is not mandatory.",
        "Example: the statement \"with added DHA (an omega-3 fatty acid) and ARA (an omega-6 fatty acid)\" would be acceptable. However, since all infant formulas are required to contain linoleic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, and alpha-linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid, it is important that statements regarding the content of \"omega-3\" and \" omega-6\" fatty acids do not imply that DHA and ARA are the only omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in an infant formula.",

        "Digestion is a complex process, with multiples components and therefore, it is not a single measurable physiologic event or function. The substantiation for an \"easier to digest\" claim should be based on all or multiple aspects of the digestive process.",

        "The International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes , to which Canada is a signatory, outlines labelling principles that promote clear labelling regarding the appropriate use of an infant formula while promoting breastfeeding. Comparing infant formula to breast-milk, including comparisons of the levels of a nutrient in infant formula to the levels of the same nutrient in breast-milk, is contrary to the message embodied in the Code.",
        "The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Health Canada (HC) strongly urge the infant formula industry to support and implement the principles of the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes. In addition, HC and CFIA guidance with respect to subsection 5(1) of the FDA aligns with certain principles set out in the Code. For example, highlighting an ingredient in infant formula as a key component of breast-milk is considered misleading as many components in breast-milk are equally important."
