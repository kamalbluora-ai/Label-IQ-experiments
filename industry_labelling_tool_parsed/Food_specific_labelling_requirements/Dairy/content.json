Therefore, if lactase is added to milk, the common name must be modified to indicate how the milk does not meet the \"milk\" standard, such as \"lactose-free milk\" or \"lactose-reduced milk\" [B.01.502(2)(d), FDR].",

        "Care must be exercised in the use of the words \"butter\" and \"cream\" in the name of a food or in descriptions relating to that food. For more information on this subject, refer to Descriptions with certain characterizing ingredients, under Highlighted ingredients claims section.",
        "The term \"milk\" cannot be used generically to describe all types of fluid milk in all labelling situations.",
        "In order to meet the common name requirement, the term \"milk\" is a reference only to \"milk\" as standardized in section 7.1.1 of the Canadian Food Compositional Standards document. For other types of milk, the prescribed common names as shown in bold face type, but not in italics in sections 7.1.2 to 7.1.20 of the CFCS or in the Canadian Standards of Identity, Volume 1 – Dairy Products must be used. Likewise, in the list of ingredients, either the prescribed common names must be used, or the term \"milk ingredients\" may be used as per item 7, Table 2 of the Common Names for Ingredients and Components document [B.01.010(3)(b), FDR].",
        "Reference to the term \"milk\" is considered to mean milk in the generic sense when Regulations refer to formulations designed for mixing with milk, for example, under D.03.002 of the FDR. These formulations may be mixed with any \"milk\" (for example, skim milk, partly skimmed milk, whole milk, either reconstituted or fresh, etc.).",
        "The directions for use or any other similar references found on labels or in advertisements should state the exact type of milk which is to be used (for example, \"made with partly skimmed milk\").",
        "Declaration of the percentage milk fat of milk used as an ingredient is considered a non-permitted nutrient content claim. It is only permitted when used in conjunction with a permitted nutrient content claim.",
        "Example: \"Made with 1% partly skimmed milk\" – not allowed \"Low in fat. Made with 1% partly skimmed milk\" – allowed as it is accompanied by a permitted nutrient content claim",
        "The voluntary use of a \"100% Canadian milk\" claim (or similar) on dairy products must be truthful and not misleading. For more information, see Guidelines for the acceptable use of \"100% Canadian milk\" claims on dairy products .",
        "Some dairy products may have non-strain specific claims stating the nature of probiotics present. See Probiotic claims for more information.",
        "Cream cheese is not included in the milk products and alternatives group because of its low calcium and high fat content. Therefore, a comparative claim between cream cheese and a milk product is not permitted. Cream cheese falls within alinea (a) of the category of \"other foods\" in B.01.500(1) of the FDR, meaning foods that are mostly fats, and may only be compared to similar reference foods or reference foods of the same food group. See Comparative nutrient content claims for more information.",
        "Health Canada has provided Voluntary guidance on improving the safety of soft and semi-soft cheese made from unpasteurized milk . As part of this guidance, it is recommended that manufacturers label their products with the words \"made from raw or unpasteurized milk\" on the principal display panel of the product and/or declare the raw or unpasteurized milk in the list of ingredients. The purpose of this labelling is to assist consumers in making informed choices about the consumption of products containing unpasteurized milk, particularly for vulnerable populations who may be at greater risk of developing foodborne illness."
