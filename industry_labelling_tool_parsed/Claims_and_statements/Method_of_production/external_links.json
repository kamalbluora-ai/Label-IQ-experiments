The PCP must also include the documents used as evidence of the measures taken to ensure truthful and accurate labelling. These measures and documents may include results of consumer engagement, laboratory testing, third party certification or supply chain controls. Refer to the Preventive control plan interactive tool to determine if a written PCP is required. If not required under the SFCR, companies may still refer to the information provided by the CFIA on PCP to help them determine appropriate forms of substantiation.",
