Companies are not restricted by the following guidance and may use an outcome-based approach for natural claims .",
        "In general, a food can be described as \"natural\" if the following criteria are met, namely that the food and its ingredients:",
        "do not contain, or have ever contained, an added vitamin, mineral nutrient, artificial flavouring agent or food additive have not had any constituent or fraction thereof removed or significantly changed, except the removal of water (for example, the removal of caffeine) have not been subjected to processes that have significantly altered their original physical, chemical or biological state (that is to say, maximum processes )",
        "Note that processes that do not significantly alter the food's original physical, chemical or biological state (that is to say, minimum processes ) would be recognized as \"natural\".",
        "Substances that impart flavours that have been derived from a plant or animal source may claim to be \"natural\". Furthermore, acids, bases, salts and sweeteners may be used to impart sour, bitter, salty and sweet tastes in conjunction with natural flavours. They do not alter the \"natural\" status of the flavours.",
        "Companies have the option of following the above guidance on natural claims in its entirety, partially adhering to the above guidance, or using other criteria and methods to substantiate the claim is not misleading to consumers. This outcome-based approach to natural claims for foods or ingredients also applies to the use of the word \"natural\" in a trademark name.",
        "Where the guidance on natural claims is followed in its entirety, regulated parties are still required to have controls in place to ensure a natural claim is truthful and not misleading. Companies should be prepared to demonstrate how they follow and meet the criteria for the natural claim outlined in the guidance, if requested during an inspection.",
        "Companies may partially adhere to the guidance on natural claims, which may include modifying the criteria, provided they substantiate any deviation.",
        "For example: a food may be fortified with vitamins or contain an ingredient or additive that has been sourced from a plant or animal and/or derived from minimum processes . While the guidance provided for natural claims would not normally recognize a food to be natural if it contains added vitamins or additives (for example, milk with added vitamins A and D, enriched flour), companies would clarify, using evidence-based measures, the meaning of the claim and demonstrate how this interpretation still meets the objective of the claim and is not misleading to consumers to claim \"natural\" for an ingredient or food, the ingredient(s) and the food would not normally be allowed to have been subjected to processes that have significantly altered their physical, chemical or biological state (that is to say, maximum processes ). Companies deviating from this must provide evidence and justification to demonstrate that a process could be considered not to have altered the original state of the food (for example, a process that does not include chemical addition) a food or ingredient with constituent(s) other than water (for example, fat or milk sugars) removed using minimum processes could be labelled as \"natural\". Companies would substantiate this deviation as described in the above examples",
        "Companies may choose other criteria and methods beyond this guidance for determining whether the term \"natural\" can be used. In such cases, companies are required to demonstrate with evidence-based rationale that both the objectives of the claim and the regulatory requirements of truthful and not misleading labelling are met.",
        "Information on evidence-based measures is provided in the section Substantiation of natural claims which follows.",
        "Regardless of which option of this outcome-based approach a company chooses to follow, companies should be prepared to provide evidence that substantiates the information on their food labels to CFIA inspectors, or as part of their preventive control plans (PCP) for consumer protection if required under the Safe Food for Canadians Regulations (SFCR).",
        "The PCP must describe the measures taken to substantiate that labelling information is not false or misleading. The PCP must also include the documents used as evidence of the measures taken to ensure truthful and accurate labelling. These measures and documents may include results of consumer engagement, laboratory testing, third party certification or supply chain controls. Refer to the Preventive control plan interactive tool to determine if a written PCP is required. If not required under the SFCR, companies may still refer to the information provided by the CFIA on PCP to help them determine appropriate forms of substantiation.",
        "Industry must also have procedures in place to respond to complaints from consumers. In accordance with section 83 of the SFCR, companies must log complaints received and how they were addressed. As part of inspection activities, CFIA can assess these records to evaluate if consumers are being misled by any labelling information. Refer to the Procedure for receiving, investigating and responding to complaints for more information.",
        "Options to substantiate a natural claim",
        "To demonstrate that a natural claim is truthful and not misleading to consumers, companies may follow the guidance for natural claims. If they choose other evidence-based means to substantiate the claim, they should be prepared to answer inquiries or adjust the claim if it is misleading.",
        "They should also be able to explain to consumers and to CFIA what the claim means either on the product label, on a website or through another accessible method (for example, commercial advertisement) to decrease the likelihood that the consumer will be misled. To help companies substantiate and explain the meaning of the claim, they may use 1 or more of the following options of evidence-based measures:",
        "develop criteria for a truthful and not misleading claim Since not defined in regulation, there may be various interpretations by the general public of the meaning of a natural claim. In such instances, companies may develop their own guidance that includes a definition or interpretation of the term or claim and criteria required to meet it. The guidance may include a process of oversight, such as verification measures for ensuring the criteria developed meet regulatory requirements of truthful and not misleading labelling. conduct consumer research Companies may opt to conduct consumer research, such as online, telephone or mail surveys, product focus groups, or customer quizzes, to determine if the consumer would be misled by the claim. While a minimum sample size is not set, the consumer research should be robust enough to draw significant conclusions. Examples to show robustness include descriptions of the research method, recruitment process, participant characteristics such as demographics, data collection method and data analysis. use a third-party certification with established criteria that are available to consumers A non-government or third-party organization may have already established criteria and methods of oversight for a claim. Companies may choose to comply with the third-party certification and use their logo or trademark on the label or advertising to identify that the product and/or the ingredient(s) comply with the criteria described in the certification. The use of a third-party certification indicates that a third party has certified the product after verifying its compliance against a standard, and the consumer can find additional information provided on the third-party website.",
        "Other means may be used as long as evidence-based measures are taken to ensure the use of the term is truthful and not misleading to consumers.",
        "Consumers have a role to play and should expect the labelling of the foods they buy to be truthful and not misleading.",
        "Consumers who are concerned about labelling information, or would like to learn more about a claim, are encouraged to contact companies directly to obtain more information.",
        "If consumers are not satisfied with a company's response, they can report their concern to the CFIA."

This criteria applies to: non-nutritive feed additives supplemental sources of minerals and vitamins that contain animal products, such as vitamins and minerals which are encapsulated in gelatin of animal origin vitamin D 3 derived from the lanolin of sheep wool Each of these claims may be used provided they are accurate, truthful and not misleading. For example, a meat product labelled \"fed no bone meal\" may be acceptable when the animal feed is free of all ingredients or components of animal origin. An exception to the above is that for ruminants, until a legally approved non-animal source of vitamin D 3 is available in Canada for use in feed, a meat product of these species fed vitamin D 3 derived from lanolin of sheep's wool may bear these claims (for example, \"fed no animal by-products\"), as long as a statement is added to inform the consumer of the source of vitamin D 3 . Some animal feed is manufactured with bakery and snack food waste that contains animal products as well as animal by-products. If this type of feed is used, the resulting meat products may not be labelled or advertised with these claims. The milk fed to an animal is not taken into consideration when evaluating these claims for the absence of animal products and animal by-products in the animal's diet. \"Grain fed\" This claim may be used when a minimum percentage of the feed is made up of grains and grain by-products calculated over the animal's entire life cycle. The minimum percentages of grain content are as follows: feed for beef and other sources of red meat: 75% feed for turkey: 80% feed for chicken: 85% The remaining portion of the feed may contain other feed ingredients, regardless of origin. Examples include: minerals vitamins antioxidants (for preservation) fish meal (as a source of omega-3 or omega-6) enzyme supplements pellet binders anti-caking agents (to help with milling and pelleting) flavouring agents medications other non-nutritive feed additives Note that the species-specific percentages are based on attainable levels of grain in feed. Because of nutritional needs, most animals are not fed diets made only of grains. Other ingredients are an important part of the feed, required to make it nutritionally balanced. \"Grain fed\" and no animal products no animal by-products no animal fat no animal meal, and/or no bone meal These claims are a combination of the criteria for the claims in sections A and B, mentioned above. For example, \"grain fed, no animal meal\" or \"grain fed, no bone meal or animal fat\" may be acceptable if the feed: uses the criteria for \"grain fed\" (section B), and is free of ingredients or components of ingredients of animal origin (section A). Note the exception made for ruminants meat products that may bear claims referred to in section A, as long as the clarifying statement is added. Please refer to sections A and B for complete details.",

Examples include:",

        "However, meat, poultry and fish products may claim \"raised without the use of antibiotics\" if the animals were raised with the following veterinary drugs or biological products (the list is not exhaustive):",
        "vaccines antisera colostrum chemical coccidiostats, such as amprolium and decoquinate direct-fed microbial products registered with the CFIA as feed ingredients",
        "Additionally, in order for the claim to be used, vitamins and minerals given to the animals may only be given at the level of physiological action for dietary supplement, not for antimicrobial effect.",
        "A claim such as \"fed no antibiotics\" may imply that the animal was raised without the use of antibiotics in cases where the animal has received antibiotics through injection or spraying. If such a claim is applied, the criteria for the claim \"raised without the use of antibiotics\" may be used to avoid misleading information.",
        "Meat, poultry and fish products may carry the claim \"raised without the use of added hormones\" on the label or advertising as long as no hormones or β-agonists, such as ractopamine, were administered in any way to the animal. In addition, hormones may not be administered to the lactating mother of the animal in question in any manner which would result in increased hormone levels in the animal. However, consumers may not be aware that the use of hormones is only permitted with certain animals.",
        "In cases where the use of hormones is legally authorized and none were used, the products may claim \"raised without the use of added hormones.\" In cases where the use of hormones is prohibited or not authorized, the claim \"raised without the use of added hormones\" may be considered misleading as it creates false uniqueness between similar products. This misleading impression may be avoided by applying an additional statement, such as \"like other (naming the product or source animal)\".",
        "For example, since the use of hormones is not authorized in Canada for chickens, the use of the claim \"raised without the use of added hormones\" on chicken products could imply that other chickens may have been raised using hormones. A claim such as \"like other chickens, this chicken was raised without the use of added hormones\" may be used.",
        "The claim \"hormone free\" used without any other information could create the impression that the animal product in question does not contain hormones. As meat, poultry and fish products contain naturally occurring hormones, the claim \"hormone free\" is not considered acceptable.",
        "The claim \"no growth stimulants\" may also be misleading for consumers and be inconsistent with the relevant legislation on truthful and accurate labelling. Due to a broad and diverse understanding of the term \"growth stimulant,\" the simple statement \"no growth stimulants\" could mean the absence of a number of substances (such as hormones, β-agonists or low dose of antibiotics) and the presence of others (such as vitamins and minerals)."

Other ingredients are an important part of the feed, required to make it nutritionally balanced. \"Grain fed\" and no animal products no animal by-products no animal fat no animal meal, and/or no bone meal These claims are a combination of the criteria for the claims in sections A and B, mentioned above. For example, \"grain fed, no animal meal\" or \"grain fed, no bone meal or animal fat\" may be acceptable if the feed: uses the criteria for \"grain fed\" (section B), and is free of ingredients or components of ingredients of animal origin (section A). Note the exception made for ruminants meat products that may bear claims referred to in section A, as long as the clarifying statement is added. Please refer to sections A and B for complete details.",
