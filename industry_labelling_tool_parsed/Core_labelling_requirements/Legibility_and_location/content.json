        "As per section A.01.016 of the Food and Drug Regulations (FDR) and section 208 of the Safe Food for Canadians Regulations (SFCR), mandatory information required to appear on the label of a food, whether packaged or not, must be:",
        "clearly and prominently shown readily discernible to the purchaser or consumer under the customary conditions of purchase and use",
        "Examples of information on a food label that may not be considered as satisfying the above mentioned legibility requirements include coloured text on a similarly coloured background, and may include impressed or embossed letters on cardboard or plastic where there is no prominence or contrast.",
        "Unless otherwise specified in Regulations, mandatory information required on consumer prepackaged foods under the Safe Food for Canadians Act (SFCA) and SFCR must be shown in characters of at least 1.6 mm (1/16 inch) in height. The height of the characters is based on the height of an upper case letter if the words are shown in upper case only, or the height of the lower case letter \"o\" if the words appear in lower case or in both upper and lower case [210(1) and (2), 211, SFCR].",
        "If a word or expression that appears in quotation marks in the SFCR is required to be shown on a label, it may, unless otherwise provided, be shown in upper or lower case, or both, so long as it meets the legibility and character height requirements. An example of this is the statement \"Keep Refrigerated\" / \" garder réfrigéré \" [209, SFCR].",
        "For very small packages that have a principal display surface of 10 square centimetres (1.55 square inches) or less, information required by Part 11 of the SFCR, other than the numerical information in the declaration of net quantity, may appear in letter height of at least 0.8 mm (1/32 inch), provided all the information required by Division 2 of Part 11 of the SFCR appears on the principal display panel [210(3), SFCR].",
        "Schedule 6 of the SFCR includes the table below, which outlines the minimum character heights that must be used on the label of consumer prepackaged foods based on the area of the principal display surface for the following core labelling requirements [229, SFCR]:",
        "numerical information in the declaration of net quantity statement about imitation, artificial or simulated flavours",
        "Table: Minimum type size requirements based on the area of the principal display surface Item Area of principal display surface Minimum character height 1 ≤ 32 cm 2 (5 inches 2 ) 1.6 mm (1/16 inch) 2 > 32 cm 2 (5 inches 2 ) but ≤ 258 cm 2 (40 inches 2 ) 3.2 mm (1/8 inch) 3 > 258 cm 2 (40 inches 2 ) but ≤ 645 cm 2 (100 inches 2 ) 6.4 mm (1/4 inch) 4 > 645 cm 2 (100 inches 2 ) but ≤ 2 580 cm 2 (400 inches 2 ) 9.5 mm (3/8 inch) 5 > 2 580 cm 2 (400 inches 2 ) 12.7 mm (1/2 inch)",
        "Note that in cases where the net quantity declaration or flavouring ingredient information is shown on all or part of a display card , \"Area of principal display surface\" in the table above should be read as \"Total area of the surface of the display card visible under customary conditions of sale or use\" [229(2), SFCR].",
        "The inspection legends set out in Figures 1 and 2 of Schedule 2 of the SFCR and shown below are prescribed for the purposes of the definition of inspection mark in section 2 of SFCA [179, SFCR]. Refer to Inspection marks for more information on inspection legends.",
        "Persons authorized to apply or use the inspection legend are responsible for ensuring Figures 1 and 2 of Schedule 2 of the SFCR are accurately reproduced. Figures 1 and 2 each consist of a circular outline containing a maple leaf with the word \"Canada\" written across the maple leaf. When Figure 1 is used, the number identifying the licence holder's establishment must replace the numbers \"00\" that appears beneath the maple leaf [2, 14, SFCA; 179, 183 and Schedule 2, SFCR].",
        "All components of Figures 1 or 2 must be in the same proportions as those shown in the images set out in Schedule 2. The outline of the circle is a specific component of the figures and must be distinctly shown as a separate object from the background. The word \"Canada\" must be distinguishable within the maple leaf. These requirements correspond to a minimum circle diameter of the figures of about 14 mm [Schedule 2, SFCR].",
        "When the inspection legend is used or is to be used as a label of an edible meat product , a prepackaged processed egg product or prepackaged fish , it must be clearly and prominently shown and readily discernible to the purchaser under the customary conditions of purchase and use. The size of the figures may be required to increase as the size of the package increases so that the inspection legend is prominently shown [208, SFCR]. Refer to the Inspection legend section of the Meat and poultry products page for the minimum size required when the inspection legend is applied directly to an edible meat product that is not prepackaged.",
        "In the case of Figure 1 when it is used or is to be used as a label , the numerals \"00\" (that is to say, the number identifying the licence holder's establishment) must be a minimum of 1.6 mm in height. A larger character height may be required depending on the size in which the figure is shown in order to show all of its components in the same proportions as set out in the inspection legend image [185.1 and Schedule 2, SFCR].",
        "In all cases where the inspection legend figures are applied or used, the circle outline, the maple leaf excluding the word \"Canada\" and, in the case of Figure 1, the licence holder's establishment number that replaces the numbers \"00\" must be shown in the same, single colour that contrasts with the colour of the background and the word \"Canada\" such that the figure is easily visible. Any colour combination may be used provided the contrast results in the image being easily visible.",
        "For example, the circle outline, the maple leaf excluding the word \"Canada\" and the licence holder's establishment number may be applied in the same dark colour to a white or light coloured background or conversely, in the same white or light colour to a dark coloured background [Schedule 2, SFCR].",
        "Care must be taken if these components of the figures are applied directly onto transparent packaging to ensure that the contrast results in the inspection legend being easily visible against the food product or empty container. If the figure is produced by applying ink to form the background and \"Canada\" word, the ink must be applied to a single coloured solid surface so that the circle outline, the maple leaf excluding the word \"Canada\" and the licence holder's establishment number result in being the same, single colour [Schedule 2, SFCR].",
        "For the list of ingredients, the phenylalanine statement, the food allergen source, gluten source and added sulphites and cross-contamination statements, the FDR prescribes specific technical requirements, including type height. Refer to List of ingredients and allergens for more information on these requirements.",
        "For the Nutrition Facts table and front-of-package (FOP) nutrition symbol, the FDR prescribes specific format (graphic) and technical requirements including type height. Refer to Nutrition labelling for more information on these requirements. For more information on technical requirements for the FOP nutrition symbol, refer to How does the symbol have to be displayed on labels of prepackaged products? of the Front-of-package nutrition symbol labelling guide for industry.",
        "For fresh fruits or vegetables, the SFCR prescribes labelling requirements, including type height. Refer to column 2 in Table 1 - Summary of labelling requirements for consumer prepackaged fresh fruits or vegetables and Table 2 - Summary of labelling requirements for prepackaged other than consumer prepackaged fresh fruits or vegetables for type height and legibility requirements.",
        "Supplemented foods prescribe specific format (graphic) and technical requirements for Supplemented Food Facts tables, supplemented food caution identifiers and supplemented cautionary statements. Refer to Supplemented foods for further information.",
        "In the case of some statements or claims regarding a food product, such as nutrient content claims or organic claims , the components of these statements or claims may be required to be of the same size and prominence when applied to the label of or in any advertisement for a food. For more information on the legibility requirements for statements or claims regarding a food product, see the conditions of use for the type of claim in the Industry Labelling Tool .",
        "For example, if a manufacturer uses the claim \"no sodium added\" on the label or advertisement of a food product which meets the requirements for this claim as stated in table D. Sodium/Salt Related Statements and Claims in the Table of Permitted Nutrient Content Statements and Claims , incorporated by reference into the FDR, all of the words in this claim must be of the same size and prominence. It would not be acceptable if the words \"no sodium\" were bolded and appeared in a larger font size than the word \"added\". For more information on these requirements, refer to Making a nutrient content claim on food labels .",
        "With respect to the lot code or other unique identifier, this information must be clearly and prominently shown on the label and be readily discernible under customary conditions of purchase and use [A.01.016, FDR; 208, SFCR]. If a core labelling requirement is used as the lot code, any minimum type height or legibility requirements that are prescribed for that labelling requirement still apply when it is used as the lot code [203, SFCR]. For information on the requirement for a lot code or other unique identifier for traceability purposes, consult Traceability-specific labelling requirements .",

It is acceptable, however, to use the pull-out part of the label for information that is not mandatory.",
        "Mandatory information may become obscured by applying a label to an irregularly shaped package or product (for example, a square label which has taken the shape of the spherical object to which it is applied); as such, these packages may not meet the legibility and location requirements of section 208 of the SFCR and section A.01.016 of the FDR.",
